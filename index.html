        body: "[DATE]\n\nOffice of the Chancellor\n230 Strong Hall\n1450 Jayhawk Blvd<br>Lawrence, KS 66045\n\nDear Chancellor Girod, Provost & Executive Vice Chancellor Bichelmeyer, and Office of the Chancellor of the University of Kansas,\n\nI write to you today urging University of Kansas administration to follow community demands to fully divest the University of all financial and cultural ties from the Zionist apartheid state of Israel and its supporters and beneficiaries, a sentiment shared by over 120 universities and counting across the globe at the time of writing. Additionally, I urge University administration to grant amnesty to any and all protestors, students, staff, faculty and otherwise, from legal or disciplinary recrimination for their role in protesting the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.\n\nAs a member of the community, I am deeply concerned by the University's response to previous student protests in support of Palestinian liberation and justice, and by conflations of activism in support of Palestinians with antisemitism in University messaging alongside mass media. Zionism and the Israeli settler state are not inherently connected to, nor reflective of the Jewish people or their faith; to associate Jewishness itself with a violent, occupying global power is a deep affront to the horrors which Jewish people have faced historically, and to the genuine antisemitic discrimination that they still face today. Moving to conflate protests against the actions of the Israeli government with protesting the Jewish people endangers both Jewish and Palestinian students. I am disturbed by anti-Islamophobia and anti-racism being equated with antisemitism when the two are in no way linked.\n\nThe University of Kansas, like many other universities across the nation, shares financial and cultural ties with many institutions which support the genocidal Zionist project, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Armed Forces, and chemical weapons manufacturers and distributors such as ICL Group Ltd, the latter of which has a site operating within our city. Yet, in the wake of over 40,000 reported martyrs in Gaza over the past seven months, it is of paramount importance that University administration move to end those ties. I urge administration to meet the demands of advocates for Palestinian liberation through 1) financial divestment of ties with the Israeli government and military, 2) financial transparency regarding how the University acquires and invests its funds, 3) demilitarization of campus grounds and all programs within the University's purview, and 4) amnesty for students, staff, faculty and citizens that may face criminal charges or disciplinary action while advocating for the U.S. financial divestment and the end of the genocide in Palestine.<br><br>I call upon you, as administrators of one of our vital institutes of higher learning, to recognize that these ties — financial or cultural — are not worth aiding and abetting genocide, nor compromising the moral dignity of the many talented people who make the University of Kansas what it is.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[RELATIONSHIP TO KU]\n[ADDRESS]\n",

Additionally, I urge University administration to grant amnesty to any and all protestors, students, staff, faculty and otherwise, from legal or disciplinary recrimination for their role in protesting the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.\n\nAs a member of the community, I am deeply concerned by the University's response to previous student protests in support of Palestinian liberation and justice, and by conflations of activism in support of Palestinians with antisemitism in University messaging alongside mass media. Zionism and the Israeli settler state are not inherently connected to, nor reflective of the Jewish people or their faith; to associate Jewishness itself with a violent, occupying global power is a deep affront to the horrors which Jewish people have faced historically, and to the genuine antisemitic discrimination that they still face today. Moving to conflate protests against the actions of the Israeli government with protesting the Jewish people endangers both Jewish and Palestinian students. I am disturbed by anti-Islamophobia and anti-racism being equated with antisemitism when the two are in no way linked.\n\nThe University of Kansas, like many other universities across the nation, shares financial and cultural ties with many institutions which support the genocidal Zionist project, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Armed Forces, and chemical weapons manufacturers and distributors such as ICL Group Ltd, the latter of which has a site operating within our city.
